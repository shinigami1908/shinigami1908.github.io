# portfolio
This is my portfolio, hosted on github pages. This website is best viewed at 80% page size on chrome.

It includes smooth scrolling a navbar and a jump to top button, the jump button was made using JavaScript rest is made in HTML and CSS. I have made it on night sky theme and the images are added according to that. No external libraries have been used in this website. The website does has some flaws and I am working on rectifying them.

I would once again request you to view it in 80% size at chrome.

Happy coding âœŒ
