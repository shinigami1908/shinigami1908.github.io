# <a href="https://shinigami1908.github.io/"> portfolio </a>
This is my portfolio, hosted on github pages. This website is best viewed at 80% page size on chrome.

It includes smooth scrolling a navbar and a jump to top button, the jump button was made using JavaScript rest is made in HTML and CSS. I have made it on night sky theme and the images are added according to that. No external libraries have been used in this website. I made this website as responsive as I could, but still it doesnt support mobile much. There is also a background music in it which doesn't work on google chrome because chrome turned of autoplay support though it does work in MS edge.

I would once again request you to view it in 80% size in MS edge.

Happy coding âœŒ
