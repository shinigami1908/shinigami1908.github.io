                I am a 17 year old fresher at BIT Mesra from Jaipur, Rajasthan. I am interested in Programming
                since class 8th when I first learnt about HTML and am doing Competitive Programming in Java and C++, these days.
                I am interested in Artificial Intelligence and want to explore that field in my coming years at BIT.

                Talking about future, I aspire to be a civil servant, I took CS as branch because I was interested in Maths, and
                CS is all about maths and nothing excites me more than making programs that's gonna do huge work in seconds.

                My Hobbies are playing Badminton and jamming on my guitar. I have been playing guitar since 8 yrs
                and keyboard for 2 yrs. I also solve Rubik's Cube and teach mathematics to my juniors in my free time, 
                which isn't a lot these days.
                Reading novels is also one of my major pastime.
